=============

Rabbit is a new stream cipher based on the properties of counter
assisted stream ciphers, invented by Martin Boesgaard, Mette Vesterager,
Thomas Pedersen, Jesper Christiansen, and Ove Scavenius of Cryptico A/S.

The C file, _rabbit.c, is a standalone Rabbit implementation. To
compile it, type:
